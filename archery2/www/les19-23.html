						<p id="i12" >Archers in the W2 category shoot from a wheelchair but have no upper-body disabilities. As a result, using standard coaching techniques is usually not a concern since the muscles used in archery are unlikely to be harmed.</p><br>
						<p id="i13">The coach, on the other hand, should always strive to be on the same level as the archer rather than standing above them, as this can be intimidating. The majority of these archers, especially those with paraplegia, will struggle with balance. </p><br>
						<p id="i14">As a result, it's important that the coach spends time making sure the archer is receiving the best support possible from the wheelchair. There are a few things to keep in mind.</p><br><br>
						<br><img src="assets/images/b1.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br><br>
						<p id="i15">1.	Check that the archer has engaged all brakes so that the chair does not wobble when drawing or releasing the bow.</p><br>
						<p id="i16">2.	Make sure the back of the chair's fabric isn't too tight. If the back of the chair has some slack, the archer will tuck himself between the uprights for protection and to keep the chair from sliding sideways.</p><br>
						<p id="i17">3.	The archer must sit on a comfortable cushion to avoid developing pressure sores. If the fabric beneath this has too much slack, the archer will struggle to maintain a good upright position. Underneath the cushion, a thin piece of board may be useful.</p><br>
						<p id="i18">4.	Despite the fact that International Paralympic Committee (IPC) rules state that the back of the wheelchair should not be too high, some archers' backs are too low to provide any support, so this should be tested and elevated if necessary. The back of the archer's chair is well below the IPC minimum, but it is at a sufficient height to provide him with some protection.</p><br><br>
						
						<b><p id="i19">Classification W1</p><br></b><br>
						
						<p id="i110">Archers who shoot from a wheelchair but have other limitations in their arms and hands are eligible to compete in the W1 class. They can use compound bows in a different class than Open Compound users, but they must have the same form of sighting arrangement as recurve bows (i.e. no peep sight or magnifying sight).</p><br>
						<p id="i111">Many archers in this class, even with a compound, are unable to exceed 90 meters, so they fire the women's distances (70/60 rather than 90/70) in international competition. The weight restriction for compound bows in this class differs from that of FITA compound bows. A man's peak weight may be 45 pounds, while a woman's peak weight may be 35 pounds.</p><br>
						<br><img src="assets/images/b2.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>
						
						<p id="i112">This is to ensure that those who are unable to pull the 60-pound maximum weight are not penalized. The main additional difficulty these archers face is a lack of balance, which can cause them to fall out of the chair when released. To prevent this, IPC rules encourage archers in this class to be strapped into the chair or use some sort of body support on the chair.</p><br>
						<p id="i113">Another issue for this group of archers is the limited mobility of their fingers. They usually can't catch the string and have to use a release aid because their fingers aren't strong enough to hold it. The form of release aid used by compound archers is common to most coaches, but it requires more control from the archer than is currently possible.</p><br>
						<p id="i114">Compound archers need more power from the archer than W1 archers, so most coaches would tailor the release aid to the archer's needs.</p><br>

						<p id="i22">There are both standing and sitting archers in the Standing class, which is surprising. Their feet are all on the deck, while wheelchair archers' feet are on the chair's footplate.</p><br>
						<p id="i23">The coach will conduct their own experiment to see how much more traction they achieve from keeping their feet on the field. Sitting in a chair with your feet on the ground is a good way to aim. Try it again, but this time raise your legs up so that they are spread out in front of you, unsupported, and you'll get a sense of how unsteady you sound.</p><br>
						<p id="i24">Choosing the correct form of seat and determining the best height for it are critical for ensuring the archer's best possible shooting posture.</p><br>
						<p id="i25">Many of the archers in this class may have arm or hand limitations, which can make coaching more difficult because the solutions may necessitate significant changes to the basic shooting style. It may be the drawing arm or the arm that should be holding the bow if an archer is missing an arm.</p><br>
						<br><img src="assets/images/b4.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br><br>
						
						<b><p id="i26">1. Missing bow arm </p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i27">the archer in this case will hold the bow with a prosthetic arm. This will need to be secured to the bow in some way, and there are a variety of options for doing so. An arm amputated below the elbow gives the archer a much better sense of what the bow is doing than one amputated at the hip. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, so the coach will have to work with the archer to try out different approaches before they find one that works.</p><br>
						<br><img src="assets/images/b5.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br><br>
						<h4><p id="i28">Weak bow arm mechanical assistance</p><br></h4><br>
						
						<b><p id="i28">2. There is no drawing arm. </p><br></b><br><br>
						<p id="i29">The majority of archers in this community choose to draw the string with their teeth while shooting. In the same way that a D loop on a compound bow is attached to the string, a piece of leather is attached to the string. The archer bites the leather and uses their teeth to pull the string out. </p><br>
						<br><img src="assets/images/b6.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br><br>
						<p id="i210">Since the leather is easily bitten through, have some spares on hand. The bow arm is bent at the start of the draw and then progressively pulled forward, since there is clearly very little room for the head to move backwards in the way that the drawing arm would. It is difficult for archers in this category to pull a heavy bow because the muscles used to draw the bow are different from those used by archers in general.</p><br>

						<p id="i33">Sitting/Wheelchair are adapted archers who are unable to stand should sit in a chair or use a wheelchair. As they keep the bowstring at full draw, this position provides stability.</p><br>

						<p id="i34">Braced is if archers have a braced support to lean against, they can stand partially upright or completely upright. The archer can need to stay in their wheelchair if they are unable to stand with sufficient stability.</p><br>

						<p id="i35">Open Recursive is the Open Recurve classification can be given to anyone who wants to shoot a recurve bow but has lower body limitations.

						<b><p id="i37">ARCHERS WITH COMMUNICATION DIFFICULTIES</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i38">Despite the fact that athletes in this group might be able to shoot in the same manner as able-bodied archers. Coaches of archers would have to change their tactics. teaching techniques in order to be able to communicate clearly.</p><br>
						
						<b><p id="i39">Archers who are hard of hearing</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i310">Various measures may be taken depending on the seriousness of the disorder. An archer who can lip read, for example, would just need to see the coach's lips for the majority of the instruction. Alternatively, precise phrases or directions can need to be written down and accompanied by gestures. The ability of the archer to know when it is safe to shoot and/or collect the arrows is critical from a safety standpoint. If the normally provided audible signal is insufficient, a visual signal may be required.</p><br>
						
						<b><p id="i311">Archers with speech impairment</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i312">Many of the same principles apply as for the hearing impaired. If the coach has too much difficulty understanding the archer, they may have to bring someone with them who can interpret.</p><br>
						
						<p id="i313">Archery for the visually impaired is the same as archery for the sighted. We all aim at a goal with bows and arrows. The difference is that some of us use a different form of sight called a "tactile sight" since we can't see the target.</p><br>
						<p id="i314">Once you've learned how to aim and developed a good style, you'll need the following items to help you shoot consistently:</p><br>
						
						<p id="i315">Foot locators to keep your feet in the same place during each shot.</p><br>

						<p id="i42">The biggest difference when coaching Visually Impaired (V.I) archers is the increased use of advanced equipment. Someone who has been blind since birth, for example, does not recognize the color "red." Allow the beginner to touch and feel all of the equipment so that they can see it in their minds.</p><br>
						<p id="i43">Many people have wondered why a blind person would enjoy such a visually demanding sport like archery. In reality, the archer can learn to judge the accuracy of a shot based on the sound of the arrow effect. When the arrow hits the gold rather than the white, it makes a different sound.</p><br>
						<p id="i44">With the archer's permission, initial shots are often taken "hands on." Physically lead them through the steps of shooting an arrow, like drawing, releasing, and guiding the bow hand. Enable them to get a feel for shooting.</p><br>
						<p id="i45">Because everyone's safety on the range is paramount, and blind athlete who is shooting must have a coach or helper with them at all times.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/b14.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<b><p id="i47">STEP 1: Elevation and direction tactile set-up</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i48">The first step in creating a ‘line' or ‘direction' for the VI archer is for the ‘helper' to lay down the foot locators. Since the V.I. archer will use the back of the bow hand as a guide rather than a sight mounted to the bow riser, the foot locators will initially appear to be pointed slightly off balance.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/b15.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<b><p id="i49">STEP 2: The inclusion of a tactile ‘back of hand' sight that allows for ‘elevation' is the next step.</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i40">A simple camera tri-pod is shown in this tactile stand. The tactile sight is mounted on the top and can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The stand is positioned or fixed down to keep the tripod from rotating as the archer presses the sight head to the side. </p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/b16.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<p id="i411">Before making a tentative change for direction, the tactile device and foot positions are checked. It's worth noting that this tactile sensation is felt on the back of the hand. Unlike conventional bow sights, this system gives the impression that the archer can shoot left since the scope head is seven to ten centimeters to the left of the fixed bow sight.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/b17.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<p id="i412">The final step of the preliminary set-up, which is the levelling of the tactile sighting head. This becomes particularly important outdoors where the ground is seldom level and caters for variables, which the tripod is unable to overcome.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/b18.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<p id="i413">The archer should now take up position in the foot markers. It is better, although unusual at first, for the archers to ‘back into’ the type of foot markers shown, as this has been found to provide a much more secure and duplicable stance.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/b19.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<p id="i414">The archer has now developed the basic line that should ensure the maximum chance of an initial hit on the boss once elevation is set up for the venue. The archer, using the back of the hand will position a knuckle joint on the ball of the tactile. Not all tactile sights use the ball but most VI archers find that it provides the most comfortable and accurate contact method between the sight and hand. The archer demonstrates the common position of the tactile sight on the hand </p><br>

						<b><p id="i416">Step 3: Fletching Variation</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i417">As many VI’s shoot short distance rounds (30 meters) where the target face size is changed to simulate distance change, the four fletch arrow allows confident nocking point alignment as no ‘cock’ vane exists. The four fletch arrow displays good flight characteristics at these shorter distances.</p><br>

						<h4><p id="i420">A mark can be made on the shaft near the nock with a ‘blob’ of glue or correction fluid.</p><br></h4><br>
						
						<p id="i421">Each method allows the archer to shoot with confidence. We have mentioned the value of a dedicated ‘helper’ assisting the VI archer and also mentioned that most VI’s do have some vision. For those VI’s who have never had much vision from birth, or those who lost vision early in life, the concept of the ‘boss’ or the ‘Target’ may be difficult to imagine. For these archers a method of providing a sense of the accuracy of a hit may be more than the normal ‘clock face / color’ description.</p><br>

						<p id="i52">Archers may have one or more of the disabilities listed above, as well as other issues that haven't been identified. There are a few other things to think about.</p><br>
						<p id="i53">The coach has some suggestions for dealing with the big obstacles that he will face while coaching disabled archers. </p><br><br>
						
						<p id="i54">1.	Because of his impairment, the archer can wear out more easily than other archers. The coach should talk to the archer about it and keep it in mind while devising a training regimen.</p><br>
						<p id="i55">2.	Tetraplegics cannot regulate their body temperatures in the same way as other people. This means that they do not sweat in hot temperatures and their extremities can become excessively cold in cold weather. The coach needs to keep an eye on this so that the archer does not get either heat stroke or hypothermia.</p><br>
						<p id="i55">3.	Since some toilet facilities are difficult to enter, many wheelchair archers are hesitant to maintain their fluid intake during events. It is important that they drink enough water and sports drinks during the day, so the coach must make sure they are aware of this and motivate them to do so.</p><br><br>
						
						<p id="i56">The crucial thing to note is that disabled archers are just as dedicated to their sport as any other archer. There are no limitations to what can be accomplished if the coach and archer work together to overcome any barriers in the archer's way of realizing their full potential. So, don't be afraid to mentor them; you'll get a lot of pleasure out of their enthusiasm for our sport.</p><br>

						<p id="i62">There are three major styles of shooting line-ups for sighted archers: Straight Line, Triangle, and Quadrilateral.</p><br>
						
						<b><p id="i63">Straight Line</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i64">When the archer is at full draw, the fingers grasp the string two to three inches below the arrow, and the archer looks down the arrow and aligns it with the required aiming point, creating a single clear in-line line-up point.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/b26.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<b><p id="i65">Triangle</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i66">The string hand fingers are positioned below the arrow on the string, which is also used to locate the facial reference point at full draw, so this technique requires a little more lining up while at full draw. The arrow's point and the proper aiming point are aligned in the eye. The eye, arrow nock, and arrow point are the three line-up points required. This approach often necessitates string alignment.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/b27.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<b><p id="i67">Quadrilateral</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i68">The eye, sight, arrow relationship (ESAR) alignment technique uses four-line up points: the eye, the arrow nock, the sight ring, and the arrow point. When using this approach, string alignment is crucial. This quadrilateral method is common among recurve freestyle archers.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/b28.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<p id="i69">There is a different kind of line up for visually impaired archers. This is also a quadrilateral form, but the field of concern is trapezoidal. The line-up points in this case are the facial reference point, the feet, the body orientation (in all planes), and the tactile sight (in all planes). When aligning the tactile equipment and the archer who will be performing, the angles become even more important.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/b29.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<b><p id="i610">Aligning the Archer’s Body</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i611">For an archer to stand erect and fully balanced many factors must be considered. Firstly, the shape of the archer’s body is very important and a method of total balance must be determined.</p><br>
						<p id="i612">Many factors must be considered for an archer to stand upright and balanced. To begin, the archer's body shape is critical, and a method of complete balance must be determined.</p><br>
						<p id="i613">When standing erect, if the archer is heavy in the frontal region, such as a broad chest or paunch, the body may lean slightly back to compensate. The location of your head will also have an effect. Also, the head position will have an effect. With some people the head can be positioned to the front of the torso, this will also have a bearing on a balanced upright stance. </p><br>
						<p id="i614">With enough practice, an archer may become very effective at maintaining a steady balance, increasing their chances of producing good form and results.</p><br>
						
						<i><p id="i615">There are many ways to determine an upright stance, but here is a simple and accurate method used in field archery:</p><br></i><br>
						<p id="i616">• Have the archer stand as straight as possible while remaining relaxed.</p><br>
						<p id="i617">• Have them lean back onto their feet until their toes want to rise off the ground (while holding their body straight).</p><br>
						<p id="i618">• Then make them return to an upright position until their weight is evenly distributed over their feet, from the heels to the balls of their feet. The distance between the chin and the floor will range from 3 to 5 inches (75 mm to 12.5 mm), depending on the size and shape of the body.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/b30.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<p id="i619">When the archer is standing upright, completely balanced, and at full draw, we need to figure out how far forward the arrow line is from the body center line. This measurement will serve as a baseline, so it must be as precise as possible.</p><br>
						
						<b><p id="i620">Feet Locator Line-Up</p><br></b><br>
						<img src="assets/images/b31.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<p id="i621">This 4-inch (10cm) measurement will be added to the gap between the archer's body center and the back (heel) of the shoes he or she is wearing. We'll use a 5-inch measurement to explain the setup (12.5cm). This will give us a cumulative measurement of 9 inches (22.5cm), which we will use to match the wooden feet locator to the middle of the target.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/b32.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						<p id="i622">Drill a hole into each of the feet side locators 9 inches (22.5cm) from the heel position of the feet locator. The feet locator can be aligned to the goal using these two pencils/dowels. Dowels should be removed after the feet position frame is lined up.</p><br>

						<img src="assets/images/b33.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<b><p id="i623">Tripod Line Up</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i624">We can add the tripod after we have the feet position frame set correctly and the measurement. When the archer is fully drawn and the tripod is positioned vertically, the pan head of the tripod should be in line with the bow hand knuckles.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/b34.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<b><p id="i625">Tactile Sight Line-Up</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i626">We can now establish a tool for setting up the tripod that will aid future tripod alignment. We can secure a piece of plywood to the tripod pan head's feet locator.</p><br>
						<p id="i627">After this piece of ply wood has been mounted, the two pencils/dowels in the feet side locators must be replaced. Attach the tactile sight to the tripod pan head so that the device can travel about while being aligned.</p><br>
						<p id="i628">Using the tactile sight plunger, hang a plumb line (the part that touches the bow hand knuckle). Align the two dowels on the feet locators and make a label on the piece of plywood in line with this line. Measure the distance between the bow hand knuckle and the middle of the arrow from this line inward toward the tripod.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/b35.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<img src="assets/images/b36.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						<p id="i629">At this spot, make a good visual sized dot (14 inch / 6mm). To line up the tactile sight, switch it until the weight point of the plumb line that was previously installed is directly over the dot that was just created on the piece of plywood.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/b37.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<p id="i630">When all of these dimensions and positions are aligned right, the archer should be able to stand in their shooting position and shoot straight down the center line to the target's center.</p><br>

						<p id="i72">Another crucial line-up must be completed. We've set up the archers' equipment to deal with any horizontal (left and right) errors, but we also need to deal with any vertical (up and down) errors. Since the floor from the shooting line to the target is relatively flat, it would be easier to obtain successful results if the next set of changes could be decided when shooting indoors.</p><br><br>
						
						<p id="i73">• Assemble the feet locator, tripod, and other items as directed above.</p><br>
						<p id="i74">• Have the archer aim at a distance of 20 yards (18 meters) to create a tactile sight height where the archer's arrows are landing in the target at the same height as the gold.</p><br>
						<p id="i75">• A length of wood doweling equal to the archer's height is required. In the center of the feet locators, position this vertically (where the archer stands).</p><br>
						<p id="i76">• Turn your gaze toward the target, align the tactile sight's contact point with the target's horizontal center line, and make a mark on the dowel that is in line with these two points. When shooting at this distance in the future, you'll have a definite 20 yard (18 meter) ‘sight target' to adjust/line-up the height of the tactile sight to.</p><br>
						<p id="i77">• Perform this operation at a distance of 30 meters; ensure that the ground is level from the archer's standing position to the target. If it isn't, the dowel's sighting mark won't be accurate.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/b39.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<p id="i78">We can now set up the entire ‘shooting line-up' for our visually impaired archer, even if the ground is sloping toward or away from the target, since we have made a dowel with the tactile sight marks clearly marked. However, no matter which way the ground slopes, the archer and tripod must be vertical.</p><br>

						<b><p id="i710">When the Ground Is Uneven, Getting Sighting Marks</p><br></b>
						<p id="i711">When shooting outside, align the feet, locating frame, and tripod as described previously. Assemble the tripod such that the tactile sight hand touch point is directly over the location on the piece of plywood that was previously attached to the feet locating frame.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/b44.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						<img src="assets/images/b45.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<p id="i712">Line up your finger, the sight mark for the distance you're shooting, and the target's center. Then change the tactile sight's height (only) so that the portion that reaches the back of the bow hand is aligned with the dowel's sight mark and the target's center. If performed correctly, this modification would be accurate regardless of which way the ground slopes at the shooting line.</p><br>

						<p id="i92">A coach who works with a group of archers on a constant basis develops a special bond with his or her students. Since the archer is reliant on the coach, the coach bears a special obligation. It is the coach's responsibility, among other things, to relieve the athlete of all operational tasks that are unrelated to the primary task of shooting arrows.</p><br>
						
						<b><p id="i93">Motivation</p><br></b>
						<p id="i94">For an athlete to complete the long journey to the highest platform, motivation, or the ability to undertake and abandon activities that do not lead to the desired goal, is required.</p><br>
						<p id="i95">Apart from talent and hard work, encouragement is needed to become a champion. Motivation is often referred to as the "killer instinct" in competition.</p><br>
						<p id="i96">Archers have their own motivation: they do it for pleasure, happiness, and pure enjoyment. This is known as intrinsic motivation, and it is a part of the athlete's personality.</p><br>
						<p id="i97">Extrinsic motivation is derived from the archer's surroundings, such as monetary prizes, trips to faraway places, status, medals, and so on. For a recreational archer, even a small sum of money to win may be an extrinsic incentive. Another example of extrinsic encouragement is the involvement of spectators (social facilitation).</p><br>
						
						<b><p id="i98">Self-confidence</p><br></b>
						<p id="i99">Self-confidence, which is a mental property, is the most significant factor in (intrinsic) motivation. In order to gain self-confidence, the athlete must have a consistent record of success. By arranging shooting at a short distance and using a large goal face, the coach manipulates the feeling of achievement.</p><br>
						<p id="i910">When the coach inspires the archer by providing constructive input, it is extremely beneficial to the archer's self-confidence. “Way to go!” is an example of constructive reinforcement. “Wonderful!” or something along those lines. In a practice scenario, try not to tell the athlete what they are doing wrong as a coach.</p><br>
						<p id="i911">Make a positive remark on what was done well and assign a task to replicate the exercise with less chances of making mistakes.</p><br>
						
						<b><p id="i912">Mental preparation</p><br></b>
						<p id="i913">Concentration. In archery, the ability to focus always determines the difference between good and bad results. Anything that should be pushed out of the archer's sight as they focus on the mark.</p><br>
						<p id="i914">Visualization (mental rehearsal of the shot) is seeing and experiencing oneself doing a professional action. Prior to the actual shot, archers can use visualization in a practice session. Non-relevant mission thoughts are suppressed by visualizing right before a shot. Visualization does not include input comparable to the real shot, such as kinesthetic stimuli or ranking.</p><br>
						
						<b><p id="i915">Goal setting</p><br></b>
						<p id="i916">It takes a long time to reach a high standard of success, and it takes a lot of (hard) effort from both the archer and the coach. Goals will help you stay motivated and boost your athletic performance as you travel this long path.</p><br>
						<p id="i917">Many properties are met by good goals. Any of them will be reminded by the acronym SMART (ER). Specific, Measurable, Action-Oriented, Realistic, Time-phased, Exigent, and Recorded are all terms used to describe SMARTER.</p><br><br>
						
						<p id="i918">• Specific implies that the target is not too broad. Goals such as "I will do my best" are not specific; they are too wide and therefore ineffective.</p><br>
						<p id="i919">• Measurable means that the result, or target accomplishment, can be calculated in the sense that it can be determined whether or not the goal was met.</p><br>
						<p id="i920">• Action-oriented implies that the target describes a result of the athlete's actions. The outcome should not be influenced by the results of other rivals.</p><br>
						<p id="i921">• Realistic implies that the target is feasible to accomplish.</p><br>
						<p id="i922">• Time-phased Goals must have reasonable time limits. (Both short and long range).</p><br>
						<p id="i923">• Exigent. Goals that are difficult to achieve inspire the archer to work tirelessly to achieve the target.</p><br>
						<p id="i924">• Recorded. Writing down the target aids the archer in staying focused on it.</p><br>

Archers in the W2 category shoot from a wheelchair but have no upper-body disabilities. As a result, using standard coaching techniques is usually not a concern since the muscles used in archery are unlikely to be harmed.<br>


The coach, on the other hand, should always strive to be on the same level as the archer rather than standing above them, as this can be intimidating. The majority of these archers, especially those with paraplegia, will struggle with balance.<br>


As a result, it's important that the coach spends time making sure the archer is receiving the best support possible from the wheelchair. There are a few things to keep in mind.<br><br>






1. Check that the archer has engaged all brakes so that the chair does not wobble when drawing or releasing the bow.<br>


2. Make sure the back of the chair's fabric isn't too tight. If the back of the chair has some slack, the archer will tuck himself between the uprights for protection and to keep the chair from sliding sideways.<br>


3. The archer must sit on a comfortable cushion to avoid developing pressure sores. If the fabric beneath this has too much slack, the archer will struggle to maintain a good upright position. Underneath the cushion, a thin piece of board may be useful.<br>


4. Despite the fact that International Paralympic Committee (IPC) rules state that the back of the wheelchair should not be too high, some archers' backs are too low to provide any support, so this should be tested and elevated if necessary. The back of the archer's chair is well below the IPC minimum, but it is at a sufficient height to provide him with some protection.


<br>
Classification W1

<br><br>

Archers who shoot from a wheelchair but have other limitations in their arms and hands are eligible to compete in the W1 class. They can use compound bows in a different class than Open Compound users, but they must have the same form of sighting arrangement as recurve bows (i.e. no peep sight or magnifying sight).

<br>
Many archers in this class, even with a compound, are unable to exceed 90 meters, so they fire the women's distances (70/60 rather than 90/70) in international competition. The weight restriction for compound bows in this class differs from that of FITA compound bows. A man's peak weight may be 45 pounds, while a woman's peak weight may be 35 pounds.

<br>


This is to ensure that those who are unable to pull the 60-pound maximum weight are not penalized. The main additional difficulty these archers face is a lack of balance, which can cause them to fall out of the chair when released. To prevent this, IPC rules encourage archers in this class to be strapped into the chair or use some sort of body support on the chair.

<br>
Another issue for this group of archers is the limited mobility of their fingers. They usually can't catch the string and have to use a release aid because their fingers aren't strong enough to hold it. The form of release aid used by compound archers is common to most coaches, but it requires more control from the archer than is currently possible.

<br>
Compound archers need more power from the archer than W1 archers, so most coaches would tailor the release aid to the archer's needs.

<br><br>


STANDING CLASS
<br><br>
There are both standing and sitting archers in the Standing class, which is surprising. Their feet are all on the deck, while wheelchair archers' feet are on the chair's footplate.

<br>
The coach will conduct their own experiment to see how much more traction they achieve from keeping their feet on the field. Sitting in a chair with your feet on the ground is a good way to aim. Try it again, but this time raise your legs up so that they are spread out in front of you, unsupported, and you'll get a sense of how unsteady you sound.

<br>
Choosing the correct form of seat and determining the best height for it are critical for ensuring the archer's best possible shooting posture.

<br>
Many of the archers in this class may have arm or hand limitations, which can make coaching more difficult because the solutions may necessitate significant changes to the basic shooting style. It may be the drawing arm or the arm that should be holding the bow if an archer is missing an arm.


<br>
<br>

1. Missing bow arm

<br>

the archer in this case will hold the bow with a prosthetic arm. This will need to be secured to the bow in some way, and there are a variety of options for doing so. An arm amputated below the elbow gives the archer a much better sense of what the bow is doing than one amputated at the hip. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, so the coach will have to work with the archer to try out different approaches before they find one that works.


<br>


Weak bow arm mechanical assistance

<br>

2. There is no drawing arm.
<br>



The majority of archers in this community choose to draw the string with their teeth while shooting. In the same way that a D loop on a compound bow is attached to the string, a piece of leather is attached to the string. The archer bites the leather and uses their teeth to pull the string out.



<br>

Since the leather is easily bitten through, have some spares on hand. The bow arm is bent at the start of the draw and then progressively pulled forward, since there is clearly very little room for the head to move backwards in the way that the drawing arm would. It is difficult for archers in this category to pull a heavy bow because the muscles used to draw the bow are different from those used by archers in general.

<br><br>



DISABILITY CLASSIFICATION TYPES
<br><br>
Standing is the most popular shooting position for archers. If their adaptive devices can be fitted for the standing position, adaptive archers who are able can stand.

<br>

Sitting/Wheelchair are adapted archers who are unable to stand should sit in a chair or use a wheelchair. As they keep the bowstring at full draw, this position provides stability.

<br>

Braced is if archers have a braced support to lean against, they can stand partially upright or completely upright. The archer can need to stay in their wheelchair if they are unable to stand with sufficient stability.

<br>

Open Recursive is the Open Recurve classification can be given to anyone who wants to shoot a recurve bow but has lower body limitations. Depending on the classification, the recurve bow may be shot from a standing, assisted, or wheelchair position. Recurve equipment rules from World Archery apply.

<br>

Open Compound is a person with lower body limitations who wants to shoot a compound bow should be classified as Open Compound. Depending on the classification, the compound bow may be shot while standing, assisted, or in a wheelchair. The rules of World Archery compound equipment apply.

<br><br>

ARCHERS WITH COMMUNICATION DIFFICULTIES
<br><br>


Despite the fact that athletes in this group might be able to shoot in the same manner as able-bodied archers. Coaches of archers would have to change their tactics. teaching techniques in order to be able to communicate clearly.

<br>
Archers who are hard of hearing

<br>

Various measures may be taken depending on the seriousness of the disorder. An archer who can lip read, for example, would just need to see the coach's lips for the majority of the instruction. Alternatively, precise phrases or directions can need to be written down and accompanied by gestures. The ability of the archer to know when it is safe to shoot and/or collect the arrows is critical from a safety standpoint. If the normally provided audible signal is insufficient, a visual signal may be required.

<br><br>
Archers with speech impairment
<br><br>


Many of the same principles apply as for the hearing impaired. If the coach has too much difficulty understanding the archer, they may have to bring someone with them who can interpret.
<br>

Archery for the visually impaired is the same as archery for the sighted. We all aim at a goal with bows and arrows. The difference is that some of us use a different form of sight called a "tactile sight" since we can't see the target.

<br>
Once you've learned how to aim and developed a good style, you'll need the following items to help you shoot consistently:

<br>
Foot locators to keep your feet in the same place during each shot.
<br>

A sighted assistant (also known as a spotter) to help you aim safely and tell you where the arrows reach the target
<br>

A tactile sight on a tripod to help you line up with the center of the target.
<br><br>

ARCHER WITH VISUAL IMPAIRMENT
<br><br>
The biggest difference when coaching Visually Impaired (V.I) archers is the increased use of advanced equipment. Someone who has been blind since birth, for example, does not recognize the color "red." Allow the beginner to touch and feel all of the equipment so that they can see it in their minds.
<br>

Many people have wondered why a blind person would enjoy such a visually demanding sport like archery. In reality, the archer can learn to judge the accuracy of a shot based on the sound of the arrow effect. When the arrow hits the gold rather than the white, it makes a different sound.

<br>
With the archer's permission, initial shots are often taken "hands on." Physically lead them through the steps of shooting an arrow, like drawing, releasing, and guiding the bow hand. Enable them to get a feel for shooting.

<br>
Because everyone's safety on the range is paramount, and blind athlete who is shooting must have a coach or helper with them at all times.

<br><br>

STEP 1: Elevation and direction tactile set-up
<br>


The first step in creating a ‘line' or ‘direction' for the VI archer is for the ‘helper' to lay down the foot locators. Since the V.I. archer will use the back of the bow hand as a guide rather than a sight mounted to the bow riser, the foot locators will initially appear to be pointed slightly off balance.

<br><br>

STEP 2: The inclusion of a tactile ‘back of hand' sight that allows for ‘elevation' is the next step.

<br>

A simple camera tri-pod is shown in this tactile stand. The tactile sight is mounted on the top and can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The stand is positioned or fixed down to keep the tripod from rotating as the archer presses the sight head to the side.

<br>

Before making a tentative change for direction, the tactile device and foot positions are checked. It's worth noting that this tactile sensation is felt on the back of the hand. Unlike conventional bow sights, this system gives the impression that the archer can shoot left since the scope head is seven to ten centimeters to the left of the fixed bow sight.
<br>

The final step of the preliminary set-up, which is the levelling of the tactile sighting head. This becomes particularly important outdoors where the ground is seldom level and caters for variables, which the tripod is unable to overcome.

<br>
The archer should now take up position in the foot markers. It is better, although unusual at first, for the archers to ‘back into’ the type of foot markers shown, as this has been found to provide a much more secure and duplicable stance.

<br>

The archer has now developed the basic line that should ensure the maximum chance of an initial hit on the boss once elevation is set up for the venue. The archer, using the back of the hand will position a knuckle joint on the ball of the tactile. Not all tactile sights use the ball but most VI archers find that it provides the most comfortable and accurate contact method between the sight and hand. The archer demonstrates the common position of the tactile sight on the hand

<br>

The figure shows the detailed contact area.

<br><br>

Step 3: Fletching Variation

<br>

As many VI’s shoot short distance rounds (30 meters) where the target face size is changed to simulate distance change, the four fletch arrow allows confident nocking point alignment as no ‘cock’ vane exists. The four fletch arrow displays good flight characteristics at these shorter distances.

<br>

The four fletch arrow displays good flight characteristics at these shorter distances.

<br>

Method of using conventional three fletch arrows cutting a ‘nick’ in the cock vane.

<br>

A mark can be made on the shaft near the nock with a ‘blob’ of glue or correction fluid.

<br>

Each method allows the archer to shoot with confidence. We have mentioned the value of a dedicated ‘helper’ assisting the VI archer and also mentioned that most VI’s do have some vision. For those VI’s who have never had much vision from birth, or those who lost vision early in life, the concept of the ‘boss’ or the ‘Target’ may be difficult to imagine. For these archers a method of providing a sense of the accuracy of a hit may be more than the normal ‘clock face / color’ description.

<br><br>
COACHING CONSIDERATIONS
<br><br>
Archers may have one or more of the disabilities listed above, as well as other issues that haven't been identified. There are a few other things to think about.
<br>

The coach has some suggestions for dealing with the big obstacles that he will face while coaching disabled archers.

<br>

1. Because of his impairment, the archer can wear out more easily than other archers. The coach should talk to the archer about it and keep it in mind while devising a training regimen.

<br>
2. Tetraplegics cannot regulate their body temperatures in the same way as other people. This means that they do not sweat in hot temperatures and their extremities can become excessively cold in cold weather. The coach needs to keep an eye on this so that the archer does not get either heat stroke or hypothermia.

<br>
3. Since some toilet facilities are difficult to enter, many wheelchair archers are hesitant to maintain their fluid intake during events. It is important that they drink enough water and sports drinks during the day, so the coach must make sure they are aware of this and motivate them to do so.
<br>


The crucial thing to note is that disabled archers are just as dedicated to their sport as any other archer. There are no limitations to what can be accomplished if the coach and archer work together to overcome any barriers in the archer's way of realizing their full potential. So, don't be afraid to mentor them; you'll get a lot of pleasure out of their enthusiasm for our sport.
<br><br>
THE LINING UP OF A VISUALLY IMPAIRED ARCHER’S TACTILE SIGHTAIMING AND LINE-UP TECHNIQUES
<br><br>
There are three major styles of shooting line-ups for sighted archers: Straight Line, Triangle, and Quadrilateral.
<br><br>

Straight Line


<br>
When the archer is at full draw, the fingers grasp the string two to three inches below the arrow, and the archer looks down the arrow and aligns it with the required aiming point, creating a single clear in-line line-up point.

<br><br>

Triangle
<br>


The string hand fingers are positioned below the arrow on the string, which is also used to locate the facial reference point at full draw, so this technique requires a little more lining up while at full draw. The arrow's point and the proper aiming point are aligned in the eye. The eye, arrow nock, and arrow point are the three line-up points required. This approach often necessitates string alignment.
<br><br>

Quadrilateral

<br>

The eye, sight, arrow relationship (ESAR) alignment technique uses four-line up points: the eye, the arrow nock, the sight ring, and the arrow point. When using this approach, string alignment is crucial. This quadrilateral method is common among recurve freestyle archers.

<br>

There is a different kind of line up for visually impaired archers. This is also a quadrilateral form, but the field of concern is trapezoidal. The line-up points in this case are the facial reference point, the feet, the body orientation (in all planes), and the tactile sight (in all planes). When aligning the tactile equipment and the archer who will be performing, the angles become even more important.

<br>

Aligning the Archer’s Body

<br>

For an archer to stand erect and fully balanced many factors must be considered. Firstly, the shape of the archer’s body is very important and a method of total balance must be determined.

<br>
Many factors must be considered for an archer to stand upright and balanced. To begin, the archer's body shape is critical, and a method of complete balance must be determined.
<br>

When standing erect, if the archer is heavy in the frontal region, such as a broad chest or paunch, the body may lean slightly back to compensate. The location of your head will also have an effect. Also, the head position will have an effect. With some people the head can be positioned to the front of the torso, this will also have a bearing on a balanced upright stance.

<br>
With enough practice, an archer may become very effective at maintaining a steady balance, increasing their chances of producing good form and results.
<br>

There are many ways to determine an upright stance, but here is a simple and accurate method used in field archery:

<br>

• Have the archer stand as straight as possible while remaining relaxed.

<br>
• Have them lean back onto their feet until their toes want to rise off the ground (while holding their body straight).

<br>
• Then make them return to an upright position until their weight is evenly distributed over their feet, from the heels to the balls of their feet. The distance between the chin and the floor will range from 3 to 5 inches (75 mm to 12.5 mm), depending on the size and shape of the body.

<br>

When the archer is standing upright, completely balanced, and at full draw, we need to figure out how far forward the arrow line is from the body center line. This measurement will serve as a baseline, so it must be as precise as possible.
<br><br>

Feet Locator Line-Up
<br><br>

This 4-inch (10cm) measurement will be added to the gap between the archer's body center and the back (heel) of the shoes he or she is wearing. We'll use a 5-inch measurement to explain the setup (12.5cm). This will give us a cumulative measurement of 9 inches (22.5cm), which we will use to match the wooden feet locator to the middle of the target.

<br>

Drill a hole into each of the feet side locators 9 inches (22.5cm) from the heel position of the feet locator. The feet locator can be aligned to the goal using these two pencils/dowels. Dowels should be removed after the feet position frame is lined up.

<br><br>

Tripod Line Up

<br>

We can add the tripod after we have the feet position frame set correctly and the measurement. When the archer is fully drawn and the tripod is positioned vertically, the pan head of the tripod should be in line with the bow hand knuckles.

<br><br>

Tactile Sight Line-Up

<br>

We can now establish a tool for setting up the tripod that will aid future tripod alignment. We can secure a piece of plywood to the tripod pan head's feet locator.

<br>
After this piece of ply wood has been mounted, the two pencils/dowels in the feet side locators must be replaced. Attach the tactile sight to the tripod pan head so that the device can travel about while being aligned.

<br>
Using the tactile sight plunger, hang a plumb line (the part that touches the bow hand knuckle). Align the two dowels on the feet locators and make a label on the piece of plywood in line with this line. Measure the distance between the bow hand knuckle and the middle of the arrow from this line inward toward the tripod.

<br>

At this spot, make a good visual sized dot (14 inch / 6mm). To line up the tactile sight, switch it until the weight point of the plumb line that was previously installed is directly over the dot that was just created on the piece of plywood.

<br>

When all of these dimensions and positions are aligned right, the archer should be able to stand in their shooting position and shoot straight down the center line to the target's center.

<br><br>

OBTAINING TACTILE SIGHT MARKS FOR SHOOTING AT DIFFERENT RANGES
<br><br>
Another crucial line-up must be completed. We've set up the archers' equipment to deal with any horizontal (left and right) errors, but we also need to deal with any vertical (up and down) errors. Since the floor from the shooting line to the target is relatively flat, it would be easier to obtain successful results if the next set of changes could be decided when shooting indoors.
<br>


• Assemble the feet locator, tripod, and other items as directed above.

<br>
• Have the archer aim at a distance of 20 yards (18 meters) to create a tactile sight height where the archer's arrows are landing in the target at the same height as the gold.

<br>
• A length of wood doweling equal to the archer's height is required. In the center of the feet locators, position this vertically (where the archer stands).
<br>

• Turn your gaze toward the target, align the tactile sight's contact point with the target's horizontal center line, and make a mark on the dowel that is in line with these two points. When shooting at this distance in the future, you'll have a definite 20 yard (18 meter) ‘sight target' to adjust/line-up the height of the tactile sight to.
<br>

• Perform this operation at a distance of 30 meters; ensure that the ground is level from the archer's standing position to the target. If it isn't, the dowel's sighting mark won't be accurate.
<br>

We can now set up the entire ‘shooting line-up' for our visually impaired archer, even if the ground is sloping toward or away from the target, since we have made a dowel with the tactile sight marks clearly marked. However, no matter which way the ground slopes, the archer and tripod must be vertical.

<br>
<br>
The archer and tripod must always be placed vertical, regardless of which way the ground slopes.

<br><br>
When the Ground Is Uneven, Getting Sighting Marks

<br><br>
When shooting outside, align the feet, locating frame, and tripod as described previously. Assemble the tripod such that the tactile sight hand touch point is directly over the location on the piece of plywood that was previously attached to the feet locating frame.

<br>
Line up your finger, the sight mark for the distance you're shooting, and the target's center. Then change the tactile sight's height (only) so that the portion that reaches the back of the bow hand is aligned with the dowel's sight mark and the target's center. If performed correctly, this modification would be accurate regardless of which way the ground slopes at the shooting line.

<br>

When you've completed all of these modifications, the setup is ready to use.

<br><br>

Guide for Quick Reference

<br>
Place the feet location frame in the correct position.

<br>

Place the tripod in its proper position.

<br>

Align the tactile sight to the center of the target and the sighting mark on the sighting dowel.

<br>
Have the archer stand in the feet location frame and double-check that they are standing upright and that all of the previous measurements are still accurate.

<br>

Make sure the archer is standing straight and aligned with the target.

<br>

One Leg Involvement

<br>
1. Students can either shoot from a chair or use crutches to support their weight.

<br>
a. Tilt the body toward target, put weight on front crutch (prop) to free another arm to draw.
<br>

b. Sit in chair if there is difficulty balancing.
<br><br>

Two Leg Involvement
<br>

<br>
2. Position the front of the wheelchair perpendicular to the target.
<br>

3. Make sure the targets are low so that students are able to retrieve the arrows.
<br>

4. Surface to the target must be smooth so that the wheelchair will move easily.

<br>
5. The range should be on level ground.

<br>
6. Does not require rigorous movement; turn chair to side and reach over side to draw bow.
<br><br>

COGNITIVE AND SENSORY DISABILITIES

<br><br>


Hearing Loss / Deafness
<br>

1. Learn how to communicate with your hands.
<br>

2. Prepare in advance a general overview of what will be discussed in class.

<br>
3. Use lights to signal the start and stop of firing (green and red), or use drum beats (a drum mounted on the ground) to signal the start and stop of firing.

<br>
4. Position the student at the end of the firing line (if right-handed, on the left side). If left-handed, on the right side, so the student can see the whole class and instructor.

<br>
5. Speak at a standard amplitude, at a consistent tempo, and always with your back to the students.
<br>

<br>

5. Extend positive interactions (short distance, light bow, large target, etc.).
<br><br>

Visual Impairment
<br><br>

1. Orient the student to the target, the bow, and the target distance.

<br>
2. Make sure the student is always facing the goal by using foot blocks.

<br>
3. The path to the target should be made of a surface with a special texture (cement, carpet, low cut grass).

<br>
4. Using guide wire to guide the student to the target may be necessary before the student is able to use the specific textured surface.
<br>

5. Behind the target, place an audible goal locator.
<br>

6. Target face
<br>

a. At first, the target should be completely covered in balloons so that the students can see when they've reached it.
<br>

b. Paint the middle of the target bright yellow or fill it with bright yellow balloons for partially sighted students.
<br>

7. Scoring.
<br>

a. A string can be attached to the center of the target with knots tied corresponding to the width of the colors. The student can take hold of the knot in each score area and follow it around to see if there are any arrows in that area. Mark knots with Braille numbers corresponding to the value of the score area.
<br>

b. Target face colors could be painted with different textures paint (sand base every other color).
<br>

c. Have buddy supply immediate feedback upon contact of arrows (high or low, right or left of bullseye) so student can zero in on the center of the target.

<br>

15.Make targets out of various textures (Velcro, sandpaper, paper).
<br><br>

PSYCHOLOGY
<br><br>
A coach who works with a group of archers on a constant basis develops a special bond with his or her students. Since the archer is reliant on the coach, the coach bears a special obligation. It is the coach's responsibility, among other things, to relieve the athlete of all operational tasks that are unrelated to the primary task of shooting arrows.
<br><br>

Motivation
<br>

For an athlete to complete the long journey to the highest platform, motivation, or the ability to undertake and abandon activities that do not lead to the desired goal, is required.
<br>

Apart from talent and hard work, encouragement is needed to become a champion. Motivation is often referred to as the "killer instinct" in competition.
<br>

Archers have their own motivation: they do it for pleasure, happiness, and pure enjoyment. This is known as intrinsic motivation, and it is a part of the athlete's personality.

<br>
Extrinsic motivation is derived from the archer's surroundings, such as monetary prizes, trips to faraway places, status, medals, and so on. For a recreational archer, even a small sum of money to win may be an extrinsic incentive. Another example of extrinsic encouragement is the involvement of spectators (social facilitation).
<br><br>

Self-confidence
<br>

Self-confidence, which is a mental property, is the most significant factor in (intrinsic) motivation. In order to gain self-confidence, the athlete must have a consistent record of success. By arranging shooting at a short distance and using a large goal face, the coach manipulates the feeling of achievement.

<br>
When the coach inspires the archer by providing constructive input, it is extremely beneficial to the archer's self-confidence. “Way to go!” is an example of constructive reinforcement. “Wonderful!” or something along those lines. In a practice scenario, try not to tell the athlete what they are doing wrong as a coach.

<br>
Make a positive remark on what was done well and assign a task to replicate the exercise with less chances of making mistakes.

<br><br>
Mental preparation
<br>

Concentration. In archery, the ability to focus always determines the difference between good and bad results. Anything that should be pushed out of the archer's sight as they focus on the mark.
<br>

Visualization (mental rehearsal of the shot) is seeing and experiencing oneself doing a professional action. Prior to the actual shot, archers can use visualization in a practice session. Non-relevant mission thoughts are suppressed by visualizing right before a shot. Visualization does not include input comparable to the real shot, such as kinesthetic stimuli or ranking.

<br><br>
Goal setting

<br>
It takes a long time to reach a high standard of success, and it takes a lot of (hard) effort from both the archer and the coach. Goals will help you stay motivated and boost your athletic performance as you travel this long path.

<br>
Many properties are met by good goals. Any of them will be reminded by the acronym SMART (ER). Specific, Measurable, Action-Oriented, Realistic, Time-phased, Exigent, and Recorded are all terms used to describe SMARTER.

<br>

• Specific implies that the target is not too broad. Goals such as "I will do my best" are not specific; they are too wide and therefore ineffective.
<br>

• Measurable means that the result, or target accomplishment, can be calculated in the sense that it can be determined whether or not the goal was met.

<br>
• Action-oriented implies that the target describes a result of the athlete's actions. The outcome should not be influenced by the results of other rivals.

<br>
• Realistic implies that the target is feasible to accomplish.

<br>
• Time-phased Goals must have reasonable time limits. (Both short and long range).

<br>
• Exigent. Goals that are difficult to achieve inspire the archer to work tirelessly to achieve the target.

<br>
• Recorded. Writing down the target aids the archer in staying focused on it.
