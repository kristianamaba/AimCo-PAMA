						<p id="i22">During the observation process, the instructor should record any possible type corrections and be ready to provide supportive and constructive input to the archer, as well as adapting equipment to the archer's unique needs as required. The mentor can cycle through the following coaching roles while watching the archer:</p><br>
						
						<img src="assets/images/a2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						<b><p id="i23">POSITION ONE</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i24">The coach ought to stand face-to-face with the bowman, fair behind the Shooting Line. This is often the most excellent position to observe an archer take his or her first shot. The coach may utilize this position to assess an archer’s hold, arm quality, capacity to draw the bow and releasing the bowstring. From this position the coach can watch the position, nock, hold and grip, posture/ alignment, raise bow, draw, anchor and release/follow-through.</p><br>
						
						<img src="assets/images/a3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						<b><p id="i25">POSITION TWO</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i26">Between the Waiting Line and the Shooting Line, the coach should stand behind the archer, looking over the draw arm elbow. You can see the archer's vertical stance in this plane by standing behind their elbow. Some archers are unable to achieve true vertical alignment or align their holding arm with the arrow. Coach can, however, teach the athlete how to maintain true vertical alignment on a consistent basis. The coach will monitor posture/alignment, anchor, and release/follow-through from this coaching role.</p><br>
						
						<img src="assets/images/a4.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						<b><p id="i27">POSITION THREE</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i28">The coach should take a position behind the archer, facing the back. From this vantage point, you can be able to improve the archer's chair, leaning brace, or shoulder position. The coach will monitor posture/alignment, lift the bow, and move to hold release/follow-through from this location.</p><br>
						
						<img src="assets/images/a5.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						<b><p id="i29">POSITION FOUR</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i210">The archer should be 15 feet behind the coach. Standing at a distance allows the coach to see the archer's whole shape as well as his or her body balance. The coach will monitor posture/alignment, as well as release/follow-through, from this role.</p><br>

						<p id="i32">Coaches play a critical role in their archers' continued growth. If the interactive environment is beneficial or negative is also determined by how coaches connect with the archer and the atmosphere they create. Coaches should take a constructive attitude to coaching as a result of this. This should be based on common sense and have a few fundamental concepts.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/a6.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						<p id="i33">A good coach will pay attention to every detail of your body from your posture to your elbow positioning. In a sport as precise as archery these are the things that are most important. At higher levels archery coaches will have breathing techniques and other small strategies to keep archers calm under pressure and to have them be able to shoot their best.</p><br>
						<b><p id="i34">Integrity.</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i35">Coaches must not allow archers to break the rules established by the official association or federation that governs the sport. They should denounce such actions outright and urge archers to follow the rules in spirit.</p><br>
						<b><p id="i36">Respect. </p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i37">To earn respect, you must first demonstrate it, and when you do, make sure it is true and sincere. Give sincere praise. Coaches will lose their reputation with the archers they are coaching if they are not honest in their praise and motivation.</p><br>
						<b><p id="i38">Dignity. </p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i39">A fundamental obligation of becoming a coach is to protect the integrity of the athlete. There shall be no discrimination between participants on the basis of race, sex, ethnic origin, faith, philosophical or political opinion, marital status, or any other factor that would be offensive or irritate anyone the coach could come into contact with.</p><br>
						<b><p id="i310">Confidentiality. </p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i311">When a coach and an archer have a good working relationship, a great deal of sensitive information is exchanged and even registered. It is important that the coach and archer agree to which of this data is considered confidential; this information must not be shared with others without the archer's/express parent's permission.</p><br>

						<p id="i42">The bow you choose for each archer must be compatible with their ability to handle, grasp, and draw the bowstring. Archers have the option of shooting a compound or recurve bow. </p><br>
						<b><p id="i43">Compound bow</p><br></b>
						<p id="i44">Most compound bows are short (28” to 36” axle-to-axle) and comfortably accommodate the seated archer. The maximum draw weight is thus the most important adaptive factor. Some youth bow models have a standardized draw length and a draw weight that can be adjusted as low as 10 pounds, allowing several archers to use the same bow. Archers would have to decide between a universal draw length bow and a draw length bow that can be adjusted.Compound bows with adjustable draw lengths are more difficult to choose since they must match the person firing them. A compound bow with an adjustable draw length should not be purchased until the archer has mastered the fundamentals of shooting.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/a7.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						<b><p id="i45">Recurve bow</p><br></b>
						<p id="i46">The first step in choosing a recurve bow is to fit the bow's length to the archer's height. In the seated position, the adaptive archer will need to use a shorter-length recurve bow. The archer would be able to adapt to the location and movement required to draw and release the bowstring as a result of this. When an archer uses a wheelchair, the bow should be short enough to avoid hitting the ground when properly carried. Match the draw weight to the archer's strength after deciding the correct bow length. Start with a draw weight of 10 to 20 pounds when choosing a recurve bow.</p><br>

						<p id="i52">Depending on the archer's release-hand feature, there are two major categories for bowstring release. If the archer has normal hand function, he or she may use a finger tab, a shooting glove, or a regular hand-held mechanical release aid to aim with their fingers.</p><br>
						<b><p id="i53">Finger Tabs and Gloves </p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i54">A finger tab is a mechanism that helps archers grip the bowstring. This flat leather device fits between the fingers and the bowstring to keep them safe when drawing, holding, and releasing the bowstring. A finger glove, which covers each finger individually, is another alternative.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/a9.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						<b><p id="i55">Mechanical Release Aids</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i56">Archers that are missing a hand or arm may be able to use mechanical release aids. Finding the best match for any given adaptation requires creativity. It is strongly recommended that you collaborate with others and use outside resource professionals such as recreation therapists.</p><br>
						<i><p id="i57">Mechanical release aids are used in archery in a variety of ways. They can be classified into a few different categories and adapted as needed: </p><br></i><br>
						
						<b><p id="i58">1. Wrist Strap Caliper (Trigger) Release Aid</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i59">Many new compound target archers use a wrist release assist with an index finger trigger that triggers the release. For adapted archers who don't have full hand use, the wrist brace is ideal.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/a10.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<b><p id="i510">2. Thumb Release Aid</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i511">Most thumb release aids come with trigger extensions that can be adjusted to fit the archer's hand size. For those who need it, a pinky-finger trigger is also available.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/a11.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<b><p id="i512">3. Back Tension Release Aid</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i513">When the handle rotates, the back-tension or hinge type release unlocks. Most archers produce this rotation with their back muscles, but some adaptive archers use their chin or mouth movement to enable the release, which is attached to their body by a strap.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/a12.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<b><p id="i514">4. MOUTH TAB</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i515">Many archers who have lost one hand or arm elect to use the bowstring-mounted mouth tab. This is usually a piece of heavy nylon strap that can be tied to the bowstring and held between two molars so the archer can draw the bowstring, hold and release the arrow. A bow sight can be easily adapted for use by these archers.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/a13.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<b><p id="i516">5. Strap-On Release Aid</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i517">The wrist release aid has been modified so that these archers can use their chin to trigger the release. Archers may also use a mouth-triggered triggering mechanism.</p><br>
						<img src="assets/images/a14.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="about" title="about"><br><br>
						
						<b><p id="i518">6. Shoulder-Mounted Release Aid</p><br></b><br>
						<p id="i519">Many release aids include a wrist strap, but archers who must adjust to using only one hand can only need a shoulder-mounted release aid. The archer can use her chin to unlock the hinge-style release, as seen in the picture on the right. The release itself is commercially available, but the coach and athlete customize the harness and release to their needs. The actual release is commercially available, but the harness and release system are customized by the instructor and athlete.</p><br>

		ASSESSMENT<br>
<br>

 


Assess each archer's current level of archery skill to determine the likelihood of success<br>


Examine his or her prior experience, physical health, motor control, attitude toward his or her impairment, and willingness to participate. <br><br>




COACHING POSITIONS<br><br>



During the observation process, the instructor should record any possible type corrections and be ready to provide supportive and constructive input to the archer, as well as adapting equipment to the archer's unique needs as required. The mentor can cycle through the following coaching roles while watching the archer: <br>



<br>

POSITION ONE<br>




The coach ought to stand face-to-face with the bowman, fair behind the Shooting Line. This is often the most excellent position to observe an archer take his or her first shot. The coach may utilize this position to assess an archer’s hold, arm quality, capacity to draw the bow and releasing the bowstring. From this position the coach can watch the position, nock, hold and grip, posture/ alignment, raise bow, draw, anchor and release/follow-through. <br>
<br>





POSITION TWO<br>




Between the Waiting Line and the Shooting Line, the coach should stand behind the archer, looking over the draw arm elbow. You can see the archer's vertical stance in this plane by standing behind their elbow. Some archers are unable to achieve true vertical alignment or align their holding arm with the arrow. Coach can, however, teach the athlete how to maintain true vertical alignment on a consistent basis. The coach will monitor posture/alignment, anchor, and release/follow-through from this coaching role. <br>
<br>





POSITION THREE<br>



The coach should take a position behind the archer, facing the back. From this vantage point, you can be able to improve the archer's chair, leaning brace, or shoulder position. The coach will monitor posture/alignment, lift the bow, and move to hold release/follow-through from this location. <br>
<br>





POSITION FOUR<br>




The archer should be 15 feet behind the coach. Standing at a distance allows the coach to see the archer's whole shape as well as his or her body balance. The coach will monitor posture/alignment, as well as release/follow-through, from this role. <br>
<br>

COACH’S ROLE<br>
<br>


Coaches play a critical role in their archers' continued growth. If the interactive environment is beneficial or negative is also determined by how coaches connect with the archer and the atmosphere they create. Coaches should take a constructive attitude to coaching as a result of this. This should be based on common sense and have a few fundamental concepts. <br>





A good coach will pay attention to every detail of your body from your posture to your elbow positioning. In a sport as precise as archery these are the things that are most important. At higher levels archery coaches will have breathing techniques and other small strategies to keep archers calm under pressure and to have them be able to shoot their best. <br>
<br>



Integrity. <br><br>





Coaches must not allow archers to break the rules established by the official association or federation that governs the sport. They should denounce such actions outright and urge archers to follow the rules in spirit. <br>
<br>



Respect. <br>
<br>




To earn respect, you must first demonstrate it, and when you do, make sure it is true and sincere. Give sincere praise. Coaches will lose their reputation with the archers they are coaching if they are not honest in their praise and motivation. <br>
<br>



Dignity. <br>
<br>




A fundamental obligation of becoming a coach is to protect the integrity of the athlete. There shall be no discrimination between participants on the basis of race, sex, ethnic origin, faith, philosophical or political opinion, marital status, or any other factor that would be offensive or irritate anyone the coach could come into contact with. <br>
<br>



Confidentiality. <br>
<br>




When a coach and an archer have a good working relationship, a great deal of sensitive information is exchanged and even registered. It is important that the coach and archer agree to which of this data is considered confidential; this information must not be shared with others without the archer's/express parent's permission. <br>
<br>


ADAPTATIONS FOR EQUIPMENT AND ACCESSORIES
CHOICE OF BOW<br>
<br>


The bow you choose for each archer must be compatible with their ability to handle, grasp, and draw the bowstring. Archers have the option of shooting a compound or recurve bow. <br>
<br>



Compound bow<br>
<br>



Most compound bows are short (28” to 36” axle-to-axle) and comfortably accommodate the seated archer. The maximum draw weight is thus the most important adaptive factor. Some youth bow models have a standardized draw length and a draw weight that can be adjusted as low as 10 pounds, allowing several archers to use the same bow. Archers would have to decide between a universal draw length bow and a draw length bow that can be adjusted.Compound bows with adjustable draw lengths are more difficult to choose since they must match the person firing them. A compound bow with an adjustable draw length should not be purchased until the archer has mastered the fundamentals of shooting. <br>
<br>





Recurve bow<br>
<br>



The first step in choosing a recurve bow is to fit the bow's length to the archer's height. In the seated position, the adaptive archer will need to use a shorter-length recurve bow. The archer would be able to adapt to the location and movement required to draw and release the bowstring as a result of this. When an archer uses a wheelchair, the bow should be short enough to avoid hitting the ground when properly carried. Match the draw weight to the archer's strength after deciding the correct bow length. Start with a draw weight of 10 to 20 pounds when choosing a recurve bow. <br>
<br>




RELEASE AID SELECTION<br>
<br>


Depending on the archer's release-hand feature, there are two major categories for bowstring release. If the archer has normal hand function, he or she may use a finger tab, a shooting glove, or a regular hand-held mechanical release aid to aim with their fingers. <br>
<br>



Finger Tabs and Gloves<br>
<br>




A finger tab is a mechanism that helps archers grip the bowstring. This flat leather device fits between the fingers and the bowstring to keep them safe when drawing, holding, and releasing the bowstring. A finger glove, which covers each finger individually, is another alternative. <br>
<br>





Mechanical Release Aids<br>
<br>




Archers that are missing a hand or arm may be able to use mechanical release aids. Finding the best match for any given adaptation requires creativity. It is strongly recommended that you collaborate with others and use outside resource professionals such as recreation therapists. <br>
<br>



Mechanical release aids are used in archery in a variety of ways. They can be classified into a few different categories and adapted as needed: <br>
<br>




1. Wrist Strap Caliper (Trigger) Release Aid<br>




Many new compound target archers use a wrist release assist with an index finger trigger that triggers the release. For adapted archers who don't have full hand use, the wrist brace is ideal.
<br>




2. Thumb Release Aid
<br>



Most thumb release aids come with trigger extensions that can be adjusted to fit the archer's hand size. For those who need it, a pinky-finger trigger is also available.
<br>




3. Back Tension Release Aid
<br>



When the handle rotates, the back-tension or hinge type release unlocks. Most archers produce this rotation with their back muscles, but some adaptive archers use their chin or mouth movement to enable the release, which is attached to their body by a strap.


<br>


4. MOUTH TAB
<br>



Many archers who have lost one hand or arm elect to use the bowstring-mounted mouth tab. This is usually a piece of heavy nylon strap that can be tied to the bowstring and held between two molars so the archer can draw the bowstring, hold and release the arrow. A bow sight can be easily adapted for use by these archers.


<br>


5. Strap-On Release Aid

<br>


The wrist release aid has been modified so that these archers can use their chin to trigger the release. Archers may also use a mouth-triggered triggering mechanism.

<br>



6. Shoulder-Mounted Release Aid

<br>


Many release aids include a wrist strap, but archers who must adjust to using only one hand can only need a shoulder-mounted release aid. The archer can use her chin to unlock the hinge-style release, as seen in the picture on the right. The release itself is commercially available, but the coach and athlete customize the harness and release to their needs. The actual release is commercially available, but the harness and release system are customized by the instructor and athlete.
