						<p id="i12" >Coaches should encourage their archers to observe the eleven steps of shooting as closely as possible. Some archers may need to make shape changes to help with consistency, or may require assistance from a volunteer at different stages of the shot process. </p><br>
						<p id="i13">Para-archery is open to competitors with physical impedances who may shoot with assistive gadgets permitted beneath classification rules. It incorporates particular competition categories for competitors with certain classifications. </p><br>
						<p id="i14">In para archery, the coach must be resourceful in assisting the archer in determining the best way to perform the shot phase in the most safe, reliable, and productive manner possible. Depending on the modifications required, each archer will have a different shot method.</p><br>
						<p id="i15">This section will go through some of the adaptations that were made in each step, but being versatile and innovative in your coaching strategies will ensure the best results for your archers.</p><br>
						<p id="i16">If the chance to coach archers with disabilities arises, seize it. It's gratifying for a coach to see a disabled archer enjoy their shooting, particularly if there are some difficult challenges in adapting archery to suit the novice.</p><br>
						<p id="i17">The most important thing for the coach to note about is that the shooting style is almost identical to that of able-bodied archers, unless the archer lacks the requisite muscle use. As a result, it is important to speak with the archer in the first instance to learn what they can and cannot do.</p><br>
						<p id="i18">Individuals may benefit from coaching in the sport of archery as they progress in their chosen sport. It is a method for learning a variety of awareness skills that, when applied, will improve an archer's strength, accuracy, and enjoyment of bow shooting.</p><br>

						<p id="i84">Once the archer has mastered this technique, you can work with them on a more complex release system. </p><br>
						<p id="i85">Other options for activating the release aid include having the archer use their chin or mouth. </p><br>
						<p id="i86">In this case, the archer may need to put the bow in their lap and use their bow hand to assist with hooking, or have a volunteer assist with hooking the bowstring. </p><br>
						<p id="i87">Regardless of the type of release aid used, it is important for the archer to practice activating the release aid using a stretch band or string loop before attempting to use the release aid on an actual bow.</p><br>
						
						<p id="i88">A right-handed person usually uses a right-handed bow, while a left-handed person uses a left-handed bow. The hand that pulls the bow string back is the dominant hand. So, a right-handed individual will draw with their right hand while holding a right-handed bow in their left.</p><br>

						<p id="i133">Drawing the bow incorrectly can cause injury to the shoulder muscles, rotator cuff, or bicipital tendon. Therefore, it is extremely important that the archer’s draw weight be appropriate for their strength and skill level.  </p><br>
						<p id="i134">It is also important for the safety of others that archers do not “sky draw” when they draw the bow back. Sky Draw occurs when the archer draws the bowstring back in a manner that is pointed at an angle that could allow the arrow, if accidentally released, to fly beyond a safety zone or safety arrangements. Correct draw weight and instructing will prevent this from occurring. </p><br>
						<p id="i135">For archers that draw the string with their drawing arm, the two most important technical concepts for preventing injury while drawing are that the drawing forearm is level to the ground and that the archer keeps the elbow as close to in line with the arrow while drawing the string back as possible. </p><br>
						<p id="i136">Archers who use a mouth tab or release aid attached to a shoulder harness, will need to increase the tension in their bow arm triceps’ during the draw in order to resist the increasing forces of the draw weight. </p><br>

		STEPS OF SHOOTING <br><br>
 

Coaches should encourage their archers to observe the eleven steps of shooting as closely as possible. Some archers may need to make shape changes to help with consistency, or may require assistance from a volunteer at different stages of the shot process.
<br>

Para-archery is open to competitors with physical impedances who may shoot with assistive gadgets permitted beneath classification rules. It incorporates particular competition categories for competitors with certain classifications.

<br>
In para archery, the coach must be resourceful in assisting the archer in determining the best way to perform the shot phase in the most safe, reliable, and productive manner possible. Depending on the modifications required, each archer will have a different shot method.
<br>

This section will go through some of the adaptations that were made in each step, but being versatile and innovative in your coaching strategies will ensure the best results for your archers.
<br>

If the chance to coach archers with disabilities arises, seize it. It's gratifying for a coach to see a disabled archer enjoy their shooting, particularly if there are some difficult challenges in adapting archery to suit the novice.

<br>
The most important thing for the coach to note about is that the shooting style is almost identical to that of able-bodied archers, unless the archer lacks the requisite muscle use. As a result, it is important to speak with the archer in the first instance to learn what they can and cannot do.
<br>

Individuals may benefit from coaching in the sport of archery as they progress in their chosen sport. It is a method for learning a variety of awareness skills that, when applied, will improve an archer's strength, accuracy, and enjoyment of bow shooting.

<br><br>


STEP 1: STANCE FOR STANDING ARCHERS
<br>
During the shot process, focus on balance and stability.
<br>

Lower-limb prosthetics, stroke, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, and other conditions can make archers less conscious of their own balance, so you'll need to work with the athlete to find an acceptable stance.

<br><br>
PROPER FEET POSITION
<br>
Feet should align to one another and stand on a balance position.
<br><br>
STEP 1: STANCE FOR SEATED ARCHERS
<br>
If an archer is using a wheelchair or stool, position the seat so that it is straddling the line with wheels or legs in front of the line and who wheels or chair legs behind the line.
<br>

Support the archer’s feet so they are steady and balanced. In competition, the seated archer must have their feet on the footrest of their wheelchair, and no back support is allowed.
<br>

Adjust the angle of the chair to find something that helps the archer’s aim. It may take some experimenting to find the appropriate angle, but the goal should be something that’s comfortable with good balance and doesn’t hurt when the archer pulls the bow back.

<br>
If the seated archer is still having stability issues, it may be necessary to devise a waist or chest strap. This will enable them to aim steady and repeat their shot execution.

<br><br>
STEP 2: NOCK
<br>
Some adaptive archers will have limited use of their hands thus needing volunteer assistance during this process.

<br>
During competition, the athlete’s classification will specify whether assistance is allowed or not.
<br>

Making sure that arrows and quivers are appropriately placed will help with this part of the process to ensure the archer can grip one arrow and turn it so it can be attached to the bowstring.

<br>
Seated archers may need a special chair-mounted quiver, while standing archers may require a hip or back quiver. Some archers may prefer having a small table or stand for their arrows.

<br><br>
Nocking Point - a fixed point on the string that allows you to nock the arrows in the same place every time.

<br>
Serving - a rolled up thread protects a section of string, preventing the arrow from falling.
<br><br>
An archer's limited hand use makes it difficult to nock the arrow into the bowstring. This move may require assistance for some people.

<br><br>
STEP 3: HOOK & GRIP
<br>
Sit down with the archer and discuss which options might work best for their situation, such as a mouth tab, finger tab or other release aid.
<br>

If the archer is shooting compound and needs to use a release aid, it is recommended to start with a Caliper Release Aid, held on with a strap or glove if needed, as they are simple to use for the novice archer.

<br>
Once the archer has mastered this technique, you can work with them on a more complex release system.

<br>
Other options for activating the release aid include having the archer use their chin or mouth.

<br>
In this case, the archer may need to put the bow in their lap and use their bow hand to assist with hooking, or have a volunteer assist with hooking the bowstring.
<br>

Regardless of the type of release aid used, it is important for the archer to practice activating the release aid using a stretch band or string loop before attempting to use the release aid on an actual bow.

<br>
A right-handed person usually uses a right-handed bow, while a left-handed person uses a left-handed bow. The hand that pulls the bow string back is the dominant hand. So, a right-handed individual will draw with their right hand while holding a right-handed bow in their left.
<br><br>
Shooting a Compound Bow with a Prosthetic<br><br>
HOOK IN<br><br>

At the first groove, hook the loop. Make sure you keep a deep hook.
<br>

Place your fingers in such a way that your index finger is above the nock and your middle and ring fingers are below the nock to "hook" the string.
<br>

The arrow's nock is located between the pointing and middle fingers.

<br>

Relax your fingers. The back of your hand should make an angle of 45 degrees.
<br>

The tips of thumb and index finger may touch each other in a relaxed way. Set your bow hand on the grip on the inside of your life line, on the meaty part of your thumb. Thumb points toward target.

<br><br>
GRIP
<br>
Establishing a proper grip on the bow handle is essential before drawing the bowstring, but may be difficult for some archers.

<br>
If the archer has an upper limb amputation, they may need to make minor adjustments to their prosthetic such as adjusting the angle of the hand grip.
<br>

Other options include building up the grip so the bow fits into the hand more consistently, strapping the bow to the archer’s hand, using quad gloves, or using a bow stand or volunteer to help grip the bow.

<br><br>
STEP 4: POSTURE /ALIGNMENT
<br>
Keeping in mind that the archer may not be physically able to attain perfect posture and alignment due to their skeletal or muscular differences, the goal of this step should be figuring out what the archer can do to get as close to proper alignment as possible efficiently and repeatedly without causing injury.

<br>

Depending on the archer, one shoulder may be higher than the other, or they may have to twist differently.
<br>

Pay close attention to the head position and movement during this step. It is important to maintain the head position and body posture as much as possible through the shot process.

<br><br>
STEP 5: RAISE BOW

When possible, the archer should extend their bow arm, align their shoulder and use their shoulders to resist the force of the drawn bow.
<br>

This may not always be physically possible, so some archers may need to use a bow stand to hold the bow while they pull back on the bowstring, or may need assistance from a coach or volunteer.

<br>

Archers using a mouth tab or shoulder harness with a release aid will most likely have to raise the bow with the bow arm bent.

<br>

The elbow of the bow arm is turned away from the string.

<br>

Raise the bow from its ready position, towards the target. Bow arm and shooting arm are in original position.

<br>

Bow arm should be forehead level and shooting is eyebrow level.

<br>

Then steady and ready for drawing.

<br><br>

STEP 6: DRAW
<br>
It is very important to help the athlete draw the bow back in a manner that is both safe for the archer and safe for the range.

<br>
Drawing the bow incorrectly can cause injury to the shoulder muscles, rotator cuff, or bicipital tendon. Therefore, it is extremely important that the archer’s draw weight be appropriate for their strength and skill level.

<br>
It is also important for the safety of others that archers do not “sky draw” when they draw the bow back. Sky Draw occurs when the archer draws the bowstring back in a manner that is pointed at an angle that could allow the arrow, if accidentally released, to fly beyond a safety zone or safety arrangements. Correct draw weight and instructing will prevent this from occurring.

<br>
For archers that draw the string with their drawing arm, the two most important technical concepts for preventing injury while drawing are that the drawing forearm is level to the ground and that the archer keeps the elbow as close to in line with the arrow while drawing the string back as possible.

<br>
Archers who use a mouth tab or release aid attached to a shoulder harness, will need to increase the tension in their bow arm triceps’ during the draw in order to resist the increasing forces of the draw weight.
<br>

These archers typically raise the bow with a bent arm and then push the bow arm out to draw the bow.

<br>

Drawing is an act of pulling the string goes directly below the chin without any changes on its standing and set up position. The edge of the pointing finger and the thumb are position under the jaw. The little finger serves as the base in anchoring.

<br><br>
STEP 7: ANCHOR
<br>
When it comes to the anchor position, it will be important to find an anchor that does not move and is easily repeatable from shot to shot.
<br>

Depending on the archer’s adaptations, a traditional anchor point may not be an option. When possible, the top priority is always to have the holding arm in line with the arrow to promote transfer of holding into the back muscles.

<br>
The hand or holding device will then touch the neck, jaw or cheek at a place that allows the bowstring or peep sight to locate in front of the aiming eye.
<br>

When the anchor point is not possible then the peep sight must be situated in front of the aiming eye in a way that allows the archer to consistency in repeating that process.

<br>

Lock the shooting arm. Draw with your back muscle and hold. Shoulder blades align to each other.

<br>

If using a sight, the string should touch the chin and nose. The index finger is curled under the jaw bone. The thumb is NOT used as a reference anchor point. Middle of nose tip touch the string and serve as anchor point.

<br>

The bow hand, draw hand and the elbow should align to each other.

<br>

Draw the string along the bow arm in a straight horizontal line to anchor point.

<br><br>
STEP 8: TRANSFER TO HOLD
<br>
Think of this step as repositioning the body slightly to brace the draw weight of the bow.
<br>

Coaches can help simulate this feeling using a stretch band with the archer in the anchor position and then have the archer slightly reposition their bone alignment until they feel braced.

<br>

This transfer movement to brace the draw weight may be very small but will serve as a mental step as well.

<br>

At full draw, transfer the weight of the bow from your shooting arm to your back. At full draw, transfer the weight of the bow from your arms to your back.

<br><br>

STEP 9: AIM
<br>
For the archer's first shot, start at a close range of no more than 10 meters.
<br>

The coach or teacher should use their best judgement to assist with initial aim.
<br>

When it's time, slowly walk the archer back to a longer distance, making sure the archer is still close enough to be accurate.

<br>

“String picture” The string lines up on the top bow limb and sight EXACTLY at the same place each time.

<br>

Aim at full draw, by setting the sight ring onto the target. Maintain the concentration of drawing hand to the face. You should see the string line up on the top bow limb exactly at the same place each time and appear a little right of the string ring. If you are cross dominant (right handed, left eye dominant or vice versa) you must shut the other eye.
<br><br>

STEP 10: RELEASE / FOLLOW THROUGH
<br>
If the archer is utilizing a release aid, it may take time to refine the adaptive device or technique.

<br>
This could include anything from modifying the materials of a mouth tab to changing the shape of the release aide.
<br>

With practice and input from the coach and archer, consistency will improve.
<br>

If a coach or volunteer is required, pay careful attention to what happens after the string is released to ensure the assistant's and archer's safety during the follow-through.
<br>

When practicing release strategies, use a stretch band or string loop. This will allow the archer to get more repetitions without being physically exhausted.

<br><br>

<br><br>
Shooting a Recurve Bow with a Mouth Tab

<br>

The fingers of the shooting hand should be relaxed when holding the string and preparing for the release.


<br>

Gently pull the string up to the back of the ear and let go.

<br>
Your sling will gently pull against your side, while your Relax bow hand will let the bow fall.

<br>
Showing that the sling has caught the bow.

<br>
Do not move until you see or hear the arrow hit the target.
<br><br>

STEP 11: FEEDBACK
<br>
In adaptive archery, this phase is extremely important. Be sure to give the archer input, but also ask for it, and be open to anything they have to say. Take the time to learn about how their condition can be impacting their shot process, and be willing to be versatile and innovative when it comes to teaching adaptations.
<br><br>

There ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO ASK:
<br>


What can I do to assist you?
<br>

Was there some discomfort during the shooting?
<br>

Do you think you'll be able to repeat the same procedure?
<br>

What would you do to make the process go more smoothly for you?
<br><br>

FORM CORRECTION

<br>

In order to teach students how to catch, draw, and release the bowstring, many archery instructors may use physical contact. When working with disabled archers, keep in mind that you might be working with a vulnerable population.

<br>

You should make sure that volunteers and team members recognize the proper boundaries for physical interaction with participants for your own safety and the safety of the archers you're working with.

<br>

Furthermore, some archers, such as those suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PSTD), autism, or sensory processing disorders, may be less tolerant of physical touch. This should be noted on the Archer Profile Form to prevent any complications during the course. You will need to model the proper type for these archers or use a pen or other object to contact the archer to see if they agree.
